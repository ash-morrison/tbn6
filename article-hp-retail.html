The phase‑out will occur gradually as existing inventory sells through, according to retailer statements shared with our newsroom.</p>
<p>Executives frame the move as a shelf‑space decision rather than a referendum on the books themselves. ‘We’re rebalancing our aisles toward frontlist debuts and faster‑turning backlist,’ said Maya Patel, senior merchandising director at the national chain Redwood Books. ‘It’s about discovery and velocity in a finite footprint.’</p>
<p>Merchandising experts note that the franchise will remain easy to find online and in libraries, where demand continues. ‘Physical shelves are a premium medium for attention,’ said Colin Shepard, a former big‑box buyer who now consults for mid‑sized publishers. ‘Once a series becomes an evergreen with stable demand, retailers often let e‑commerce do more of the work while stores spotlight what’s new.’</p>
<p>The implications extend across adjacent categories. A children’s buyer at a regional chain, Amira Johnson, expects table real estate to tilt toward graphic novels and illustrated nonfiction. ‘Kids discover by browsing,’ Johnson said. ‘If I can rotate six under‑the‑radar titles through the same space where a single perennial once sat, I create more chances for a child to fall in love with something unexpected.’</p>
<p>Not everyone is cheering. ‘I worry about serendipity shrinking,’ said Thomas Greene, a public librarian in Ohio, who partners with nearby stores on family reading nights. ‘Those big classics act like magnets. Take them away and you change the way kids roam the shelves.’ Greene added that his library will expand display space for fantasy series to preserve that effect.</p>
<p>Publishers monitoring the transition say the franchise’s sales curve has long since stabilized. ‘Print units remain strong in wholesale and special markets, but the growth is in audio and boxed sets online,’ said Leah Kim, a sales VP at a major trade house not affiliated with the series. Kim predicted that removing the series from planograms would free seasonal promotional funds for debuts. ‘That’s good for the pipeline.’</p>
<p>Independent bookstores see opportunity. ‘We’ve never stopped handselling the series—and we don’t plan to,’ said Carmen Ortega, owner of Third Place Books & Tea in Albuquerque. ‘If chains step back, we can lean in with themed events and starter bundles for new readers.’ Some indies also anticipate higher backlist sales as families seek advice on reading orders and spin‑offs.</p>
<p>The business logic behind the change is straightforward: freight and labor costs have risen, returns erode margin, and space resets happen on tighter cycles. ‘You want more high‑probability bets per linear foot,’ said Sean Dwyer, who oversees category analytics at retail data firm BrightStack. ‘That favors rotating frontlist, seasonal displays, and maker‑adjacent books that merchandise well with gifts and games.’</p>
<p>Educators caution against misreading the moment. ‘A generation discovered reading through this series,’ said Dr. Elena Rossi, a literacy researcher. ‘Kids will still meet it through school libraries, older siblings, and streaming tie‑ins. The question for retailers is what new worlds they’ll place near the cash wrap to spark the next wave of lifelong readers.’</p>
<p>For now, the phase‑out is a reminder that iconic titles are not immune to the math of modern retail. The franchise will endure; the aisle is what’s changing. As Patel put it, ‘There’s no shortage of love for these books. We’re just giving more new voices a seat at the table.’</p><hr class="rule" /><section aria-label="Tags"><span class="tag">Books</span> <span class="tag">Retail</span> <span class="tag">Publishing</span> <span class="tag">Backlist</span> <span class="tag">Marketplace</span></section></div></div><aside aria-label="Related content" id="related"><div class="box" role="complementary"><h3>More in Retail</h3><ul class="list-plain"><li><a href="chains-backlist-placement.html">How chains are rethinking backlist placement</a></li><li><a href="indie-curation-opportunity.html">Indie bookstores see opportunity in curation</a></li><li><a href="audiobook-growth-outpaces-print.html">Audiobook growth outpaces print sales</a></li></ul></div><div class="box" style="margin-top:16px" id="analysis"><h3>Analysis</h3><ul class="list-plain"><li><a href="economics-shelf-space-discovery.html">The economics of shelf space and discovery</a></li><li><a href="evergreen-bestsellers-online.html">When perennial bestsellers become ‘evergreen’ online</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><div class="dialog-backdrop" id="share-dialog" role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="share-title"><div class="dialog"><h3 id="share-title">Share this article</h3><p style="margin:0 0 8px 0;font-family:var(--sans);color:#444">Copy the link or share via email.</p><div class="row"><input type="text" id="share-url" aria-label="Article URL" readonly /><button class="btn" id="btn-dialog-copy">Copy</button></div><div class="actions"><a class="btn" id="btn-dialog-email" href="#">Email</a><button class="btn btn--brand" id="btn-dialog-close">Close</button></div></div></div><div class="toast" id="toast" role="status" aria-live="polite">Copied!</div><script src="script.js"></script></body></html>
